			<h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Who we are</h3>
			<p class="mt-8 text-secondary">
				Our website address is: <a href="https://arkehub.com">https://arkehub.com</a>.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8">Information</h3>
			<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">What are cookies?</h4>
			<p class="mt-8 text-secondary">
				Cookies are small text files which are stored on your device when you visit a website that uses them.
				These cookies can serve a variety of purposes, but their general purpose is to store information which
				makes your browsing experience smoother and more convenient. For example, when you log into your account,
				a cookie may be saved which states your logged in. Then you won’t have to log in again next time you
				browse to our site.

				Cookies can come both from the site you’re visiting and third parties who place cookies on our site.
				Some cookies are deleted as soon as you close your browser, while others remain and need to be
				manually deleted.
			</p>

			<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">What types of cookies do we use?</h4>
			<p class="mt-8 text-secondary">
				On our website, we use three different kinds of cookies:
			</p>

			<h5 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4">Necessary cookies</h5>
			<p class="mt-4 text-secondary">
				These are cookies which are required for our website to function. Our site uses these to perform basic
				tasks like logging you into your account and remembering your privacy settings. These cookies do not
				store any personally identifiable information, and do not track you in any way.

				Since these features are integral to the functioning of our website, we can’t offer the option to
				turn these cookies off. If you still wish to disable them, most browsers offer settings or extensions
				that can do this for you. However, take note that if you do, some parts of the site may not work
				properly.
			</p>

			<h5 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4">Functional cookies</h5>
			<p class="mt-4 text-secondary">
				These are cookies that give us more insight into how our visitors use our website.
				These cookies allow us to count visitors and track how users move through our website.
				We can use this information to improve our website and offer our customers a more optimal experience.
				All information these cookies collect is completely anonymous. Nothing these cookies collect can ever
				be traced back to you. You can choose whether you want to allow these cookies or not.
			</p>

			<h5 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4">Analytical cookies</h5>
			<p class="mt-4 text-secondary">
				These cookies come from our business and advertising partners. In other words, they come from external
				websites run by third parties. They may use these to get an idea of the topics you’re interested in,
				and then use this information to show you more personalized advertisements on other websites.

				These cookies do not store personally identifiable information, but they work using a unique
				identifying number that’s connected to your browser and device. These cookies may track your activity
				across multiple websites. You can choose whether to allow these cookies or not. If you choose to not
				allow them, you will see fewer personalized advertisements.
			</p>

			<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Deleting existing cookies</h4>
			<p class="mt-8 text-secondary">
				We are unable to delete our cookies for you, as they are saved locally on your device. You can
				delete cookies from our site in your browser’s settings. The way this is done varies between browsers,
				but generally a feature for this is laid out clearly in your browser’s settings. Please refer to
				your browser’s support page for more information on how to delete cookies.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				If you change your cookie preferences, we will of course follow your new preferences.
				However, some old cookies from your previous settings may still remain on your device. If you want
				to delete these, you can do so manually as described earlier.
			</p>

			<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Changes to this policy</h4>
			<p class="mt-8 text-secondary">
				We reserve the right to make changes to our privacy policy. When these changes are significant
				enough to require asking for your cookie preferences again, we will do so. If you do not agree with
				the new policy, you are free to change your preferences at any point.
			</p>
